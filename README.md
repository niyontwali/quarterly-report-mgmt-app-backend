# Quarterly Report Management App - Backend

This is an application that is aimed at resolving the issues workers face while working on their reports. Most of the companies use documents created and have employees fill them or they use google docs and share the documents. This application will allow every employee to have their own dashboard where they can manage their planned activities and are able to save them. Once the time to submit the report reaches they can submit the report and get reviewed by their supervisor or superior. 

This app will also have the ability to create analysis for the superior in accordance to the data provided by the employee they are supervising. THe analysis will be in form of graphs and statements.
